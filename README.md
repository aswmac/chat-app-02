On the web page,  have two chat windows where text can be input for the one respective side of the chat. The windows will be claimed first come first serve, where only one client can have control of the one text input window. When one person claims one window, then what they type is seen live in all viewer's version of that window. The typing should be transmitted live, meaning that as each character is typed, it should show up on all views. There are buttons that claim the window and release the window in order to have only one user at a time with that text window. When a user claims a window, the server is notified and a message is printed to the console. A claimed window should have a color change giving indication of ownership for the user, do not give a message other than that to the user. Anyone viewing the webpage will be able to see the live text regardless of if they have a claim to a window or not. Anyone joining the webpage at any time should be able to see all the chat history, and the chat history should persist even if a user disconnects, the chat should remain upon reconnection. For now ownership of windows can be changed by anyone with the release then claim buttons. The chat history will be one session as if it were a graphiti board being drawn on, no erasing of any of the previous text will be allowed"
...
Then navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. You can open multiple tabs or browsers to see the live interaction and chat history persistence.

This implementation covers all the requirements you mentioned: two chat windows that can be claimed and released by users, real-time typing transmission, chat history persistence upon reconnection, and ownership indication through color change.
